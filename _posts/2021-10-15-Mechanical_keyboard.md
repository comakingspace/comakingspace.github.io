# Background
I designed this custom mechanical keyboard case including the keycaps. The PCB I used for this project is the DZ60rgb v3 hot-swappable, therefore no soldering is required. I personally like small and compact keyboards, that is why I choose a 60% layout. The PCB is configured via QMK, which allows you to pretty much re-programm all the keys. For this build, I have also added four small white LEDs on the back, which I soldered directly on the board (there is a 5v output pin somewhere on the board). These four LEDs are static and cannot be controlled via the software and light up as soon as you plug your USB-C cable in the keyboard. One 750g spool of regular PLA should be more than enough to print this keyboard.

# Features
The main features of this keyboard are:
* Gasket Mount
* No screws are required
* fully 3D printable

# Tutorial / Download
A full tutorial is available on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/KalunHo) channel. The file is also available on Thingiverse.
