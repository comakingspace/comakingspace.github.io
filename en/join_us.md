## HOW IT WORKS
{: .center}

We set up the CoMakingSpace as a non-profit organisation (gemeinn√ºtzige GmbH) in order to give our idea a solid legal and financial foundation. Members make the Space sustainable with their contributions and enjoy a friendly community where help and inspiration for the next project is never far away.
